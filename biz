Converstaion can be broken down into five steps:
• Plan- It needs to have a clear objective in our mind. We should have a proper topic before
we start our conversation.

predefined lines that will help to start conversation.

to understand not with an intent to reply.

SS5- Listening Skills:
Only having good conversation skills, it does not mean that we are very good with our language or
we are good in communication. We should have good listening skills also. Because it helps us to

Five levels of Listening Skills:

speaker. It could be happened when listner is not very keen in listning or when listner is not
interested in the topic which is going on.

listening but in reality he doesn't. It could be happened when listner is disturbed because of
some external distractions or he is preoccupied with other thoughts.
3. Selective- This is the third level of listening where the listner listens certain parts of the
conversation and ignores the rest. It could be happened when the listner already knows
about the topic. Demerit is that we might miss out some valuable information.

speaker's message. It is important because the understandability of the listner cannot be
validated due to lack of interaction.

ready for the interaction with the speaker. Listner always tries to focus on the speaker with
